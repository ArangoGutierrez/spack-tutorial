[![Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/spack-tutorial/badge/?version=latest)](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io)

Spack is a multi-platform package manager that builds and installs multiple versions and configurations of software. It works on Linux, macOS, and many supercomputers. Spack is non-destructive: installing a new version of a package does not break existing installations, so many configurations of the same package can coexist.

This repository houses Spack's [**hands-on tutorial**](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is a subset of Spack's [**full documentation**](https://spack.readthedocs.io/) (or you can run `spack help` or `spack help --all`).

This tutorial covers basic to advanced usage, packaging, developer features, and large HPC deployments.  You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop using a Docker container. Feel free to use these materials to teach users at your organization about Spack.
